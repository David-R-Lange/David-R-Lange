Hi, Iâ€™m @David-R-Lange

I'm a student in Hanover, Germany. 
I've learned Numerical Mathematics and Simulations with the languages Octave/Matlab and C/C++
at my university. I want to deepen my knowledge of what is possible with C++.
Many things in Computer Science interest me, but nothing more than Game Development and almost
everything associated with that. I would especcially like to learn Game Engine Programming,
Emulation and Graphics Programming.
