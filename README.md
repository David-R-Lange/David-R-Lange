# Hi, Iâ€™m @David-R-Lange  

I'm a student in Hanover, Germany. 
I've learned Numerical Mathematics and Simulations with the languages Octave/Matlab and C/C++
at my university.  
I want to deepen my knowledge of what is possible with C++.

## Interests

Many things in Computer Science interest me, but nothing more than Game Development and almost
everything associated with that.  
I would especcially like to learn Game Engine Programming,
Emulation and Graphics Programming.

## REMINDER:

Due to me learning Programming and showing what **I** have learned, I will never use any kind of AI (Github Copilot or ChatGPT) to help me, when I'm stuck or otherwise.

## Socials:

You can reach me via my email: renedavidbrueggemann@gmail.com
